title: Mechanical Lead
description: Cyclone RoboSub builds fully autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) for international competition and research, empowering students to master robotics at UC Davis. As Mechanical Lead, I designed the control system and derived critical propulsion equations to ensure precise underwater performance. I also developed a torpedo launcher, ball dropper, and internal housing structure, enhancing the AUV’s functionality. Beyond the vehicle, I created 'RoboCart,' a bike-towable trailer that streamlines transport to competition sites. Off the workshop floor, I collaborated with our PR team to secure sponsorships, raising over $12,000 to fuel our mission.
skills: 
- Control system design
- CAD (OnShape)
- 3D printing
- Breadboard prototyping
- Soldering
- Programming (Python, C, MATLAB/Simulink)
- Embedded systems (Raspberry Pi, Arduino)
- Mechanical fabrication

As a founding member of the club, I’ve been deeply involved in every stage of our autonomous underwater vehicle’s (AUV) design and manufacturing process. This experience has significantly honed my CAD skills, particularly in OnShape, where I contributed to modeling the vehicle’s intricate components. Beyond technical drafting, I’ve learned to integrate prototyping and manufacturing considerations into my designs—optimizing parts for 3D printing and ensuring compatibility with Arduino and Raspberry Pi systems. Collaborating with a diverse team of students, spanning all levels of expertise, has further sharpened my ability to create practical, production-ready solutions.
