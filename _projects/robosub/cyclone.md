title: Mechanical Lead
description: I contributed to the development of a fully autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) by designing its control system and deriving key propulsion equations. I assisted in the design, development, and fabrication of a torpedo launcher and ball dropper. Additionally, I co-designed and constructed 'RoboCart,' a custom trailer optimized for transporting the AUV and essential equipment to competition and testing sites. Tailored to our campusâ€™s bike-friendly ethos, RoboCart can be towed by bicycle or pulled by hand.
skills: 
- Control system design
- CAD (OnShape)
- 3D printing
- Breadboard prototyping
- Soldering
- Programming (Python, C, MATLAB/Simulink)
- Embedded systems (Raspberry Pi, Arduino)
- Mechanical fabrication

# Header 1 
Used for the title (already generated automatically at the top)
## Header 2  
Use this for the header of each section
### Header 3

## Embedding images 
### External images
{% include image-gallery.html images="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52821641477_d397e56bc4_k.jpg, https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52822650673_f074b20d90_k.jpg" height="400"%}
<span style="font-size: 10px">"Starship Test Flight Mission" from https://www.flickr.com/photos/spacex/52821641477/</span>  
You can put in multiple entries. All images will be at a fixed height in the same row. With smaller window, they will switch to columns.  

### Embeed images
{% include image-gallery.html images="Submarine_Pool.JPG" height="400" %} 
place the images in project folder/images then update the file path.   


## Embedding youtube video
The second video has the autoplay on. copy and paste the 11-digit id found in the url link. <br>
*Example* : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v={**MhVw-MHGv4s**}&ab_channel=engineerguy
{% include youtube-video.html id="MhVw-MHGv4s" autoplay= "false"%}
{% include youtube-video.html id="XGC31lmdS6s" autoplay = "true" %}

you can also set up custom size by specifying the width (the aspect ratio has been set to 16/9). The default size is 560 pixels x 315 pixels.  

The width of the video below. Regardless of initial width, all the videos is responsive and will fit within the smaller screen.
{% include youtube-video.html id="tGCdLEQzde0" autoplay = "false" width= "900px" %}
