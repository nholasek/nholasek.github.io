title: Mechanical Lead
description: I contributed to the development of a fully autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) by designing its control system and deriving key propulsion equations. I assisted in the design, development, and fabrication of a torpedo launcher and ball dropper. Additionally, I co-designed and constructed 'RoboCart,' a custom trailer optimized for transporting the AUV and essential equipment to competition and testing sites. Tailored to our campusâ€™s bike-friendly ethos, RoboCart can be towed by bicycle or pulled by hand.
