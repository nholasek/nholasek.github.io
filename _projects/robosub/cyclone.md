title: Mechanical Lead
description: Cyclone RoboSub builds fully autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) for international competition and research, empowering students to master robotics at UC Davis. As Mechanical Lead, I designed the control system and derived critical propulsion equations to ensure precise underwater performance. I also developed a torpedo launcher, ball dropper, and internal housing structure, enhancing the AUVâ€™s functionality. Beyond the vehicle, I assisted in the creation of 'RoboCart,' a bike-towable trailer that streamlines transport to competition sites. Off the workshop floor, I collaborated with our PR team to secure sponsorships, raising over $12,000 to fuel our mission.

{% include image-gallery.html images="project1.jpg" height="400" %}
Each component of the AUV is carefully designed and fabricated using a combination of CNC machining, 3D printing, and traditional manufacturing techniques. The modular design allows for easy maintenance and upgrades while ensuring structural integrity and water-tightness.

## RoboCart
{% include image-gallery.html images="project1.jpg" height="400" %}
The RoboCart is a custom-designed transport and testing platform for the AUV. It provides a stable environment for testing and maintenance, featuring integrated power systems, testing equipment, and safety features to ensure proper handling of the vehicle.

## Fundraising
