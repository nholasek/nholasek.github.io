description: As part of one of the teams selected for the 2024–25 CITRIS Aviation Prize. Our team advanced to the final phase, presenting our solutions to NASA alongside sponsors such as MATLAB, Archer, Supernal and others. We were honored with three major awards: 
- Atech Award for Most Innovative Design for Air Mobility
- DART Community Integration Award
- CITRIS Aviation Award for Most Comprehensive Software Design.

My primary focus was leading the Community Integration strategy, where I developed pathways for pilot training, identified strategic locations, and assessed costs by interpolating data from similar modes of transportation. I also explored sustainable energy generation options—such as wind and solar—to support eVTOL operations, analyzing both infrastructure needs and long-term feasibility.

On the technical side, I supported our path planner's development by supplying real-time data for obstacle avoidance and energy optimization. Using a custom Python script, I integrated USGS DTED for elevation awareness, NOAA HRRR wind vectors for optimized routing, and polygon mapping for hazard detection. I also employed SUMO (Simulation of Urban Mobility) to validate the logistics of our system, demonstrating through simulations that eVTOL travel significantly outperforms traditional car travel in speed and efficiency.

As one of our team's presenters, I articulated our design and findings at NASA Ames, showcasing the seamless integration of advanced technologies and sustainable strategies for the future of intercampus air mobility.
