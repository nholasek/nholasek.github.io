title: CITRIS Aviation
description:  As a member of one of four teams selected from the University of California’s CITRIS campuses to advance to Phase 2 of the 2024–25 CITRIS Aviation Prize, I contributed to designing an innovative air operations system for UC air mobility. Focused on integrating electric Vertical Takeoff and Landing (eVTOL) solutions into campus transportation networks, I developed optimized flight paths, schedules, and cost functions to enhance efficiency and safety. I simulated weather dynamics, and traffic data, aligning with the competition’s goal of seamless campus interconnectivity. This work, part of a multiyear effort to revolutionize intercampus travel, culminated in a detailed design presentation for final review at NASA Ames in spring 2025.
